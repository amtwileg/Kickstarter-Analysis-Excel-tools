Kickstarting with ExcelOverview of ProjectPurposeThe purpose of this analysis was to determine the conditional limitations to, as well as prospective inferences of, campaign funding for fundraising outcomes based on statistical methods to confer data.Analysis and ChallengesUsing the Kickstarter dataset, the visual representation of analytical models showed linear relationships between variables contiguous with Excel tools. Pivot tables and charts were utilized to configure visual analytical guidelines by which later inferences were thereby made. Challenges in learning to use Microsoft software in the context of Excel spreadsheets were accompanied by performing evaluative analyses based on input data. Moreover, the challenge of uploading the raw material to generate these visual and analytical findings were further exacerbated using novel software, which ultimately led to consequential results in data presentation based on retrieval.Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch DateTwo conclusive findings were evident from analytical measures performed, exacting time of year relations and campaign type as dependent variables. Specifically, the month of May was shown to be conducive toward campaign success, as well as duration of such campaign was shown to be ideal surrounding such length. Therefore, it may be concluded that launching such campaign would ideally take place between the months of November through March and success rate would also be mediated by theater type. Analysis of Outcomes Based on GoalsIn order to achieve optimal results in Louise's theater launching campaign, the findings suggest a focus on time-dependent measures and dimensional variables should be considered. In doing so, evaluative consenses rests upon these criteria variables to determine prospective outcomes for successful campaign results.### Challenges and Difficulties EncounteredUsing the statistical methodologies for calculating the Mean, Median and Mode within the datasets posed a challenge in analyzing the results based on the results. It seems that an incongruency exists between funding and campaign measures, which indicates the need for further evaluative methods for inferring the conclusive results.Thus, the need for visualization in graphically depicting the data becomes a valuable strategical method by which to confer results.## ResultsResulting evidence suggests that greater emphasis on theatrical type may be salient to differing communities, with greater emphasis on theaters/plays having higher success rates among these groups.  In addition, time of year was shown to be a salient factor in determining fundraising success rates, depicting time of year importance in launching campaign pursuits. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?The month of May was shown to be more prosperous in generating succesful results, as well as theater-based factors also playing a large role. Furthermore, the prospect of funding shows greater success for social constructs, in addition to fundraising fail rates higher in other categories. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?Based on the emerging evidence, it can be concluded that campaign success rates are driven by certain variables related to theater/play subcategories, as well as timely values to predict success.What are some limitations of this dataset?Some limitations of this dataset may include the dismissal of further insight due to face-value results, without which further scrutiny would be often overlooked. In taking a closer look at certain variables, however, one may conclusively determine other factors otherwise overlooked in determining resulting conclusions by way of assessing the data as a function of scientific analytical tools. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?When outliers exist between variables, such as diffrences between groups, it may be beneficial to consider bar graphs; however, utilizing box plots to represent outliers, as in the case for within-group analyses, may highlight certain factors such as preferential emphasis on subcategorical data. Thus, the need for these differential visual representations can prove to be a valuable asset as a tool for determining prospective results.
